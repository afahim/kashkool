Twitter for pictures. Django based platform to share pictures using hashtags, see trending pictures, with size dictating a picture's popularity.

The application was built as part of NYU's Social Good Hackathon, and the intent is to capture trending stories in terms of text, and being able to visualize these stories on an HTML5 based platform.

The original application included came with an iOS accompanying app that is used to capture, edit and send pictures to the Django server.
